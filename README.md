Welcome to the Brain Games.
The Brain Games is a project which includes five math games.
Each game is selected by user. User should enter game's name for start the game.
Every game has three math questions. Questions are asked in turn.
User has to answer correctly three times for winning, overwise the game is over.
Games which are included:
Brain-even(determining an even number or not)
Brain-calc(calculating simple math expression)
Brain-gcd(calculating the greatest common divisor)
Brain-progression(calculating missing number in progression)
Brain-prime(determining a prime number or not)
Examples of running each game are below.
