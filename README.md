Welcome to the Brain Games.
The Brain Games is a project which include five math games.
Each game is selected by user. User should enter game's name.
Every game has three math questions. Questions are asked in turn.
User has to answer correctly three times for winning, overwise the game is over.
Games which are included:
Brain-even(determining an even number or not)
Brain-calc(calculating simple math expression)
Brain-gcd(calculating the greatest common divisor)
Brain-progression(calculating missing number in progression)
Brain-prime(determining a prime number or not)
